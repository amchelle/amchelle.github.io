I think one of my favorite parts about sourdough is the scoring step. Its where you can make your loaf unique and bring out the artist in you. I have had some beautifully scored loaves and some really horrible ones. Here are some of the tips and tricks I have learned along the way.
You may be surprised to know that scoring has a huge impact on how your dough expands.
When your bread rises in the oven, scoring guides it to expand in a specific place. Expansion and tears occur in the weak points.

Steps to prep for a nice score. Shaping your dough properly so that you have the right tension and reduce unwanted tears.

Lower hydration is going to be easier to score, it will also provide more of an oven spring.

### How to score and get a massive sourdough ear

70% hydration provides the best ear. It has good oven spring. You want to do a boule with a crescent score. The crescent is important, you don't want a slash down the middle. Use a bread lame
