Your go-to classic sourdough loaf. Crunchy, golden crust with soft crumb and so much flavor! Follow this recipe to make your best loaf with a beautiful ear and perfect taste.

I have tested different ingredient combinations, temperature and time fluctuations, and hydration levels to get my signature classic sourdough. This is my favorite everyday loaf! I generally prefer a tighter, even crumb. I don't like large holes in my daily bread, I save that for more artisanal loaves. If you desire larger holes, you can add more water to this recipe and make sure you perform all three strech and folds.

### What are the timings?

- **8:00 am:** feed starter
- **1:00 pm:** mix dough
- **1:30 pm:** autolyse
- **2:00 pm:** stretch and fold
- **2:30 pm:** stretch and fold
- **3:00 pm:** stretch and fold
- **8:00 pm:** shape
- **8:00 am(next day):** preheat oven
- **9:00 am:** bake

# Step by Step Instructions

### 1. Feed your starter

I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.

### 2. Mix your dough

Once your starter is a peak, bubbly, and doubled in size you will make your dough. My starter takes about 5-6 hours. This is going to vary depending on the temperature of your home.

For your dough you can use a ceramic, Pyrex, glass, or stainless steel bowl. I like to use a Pyrex bowl and a glass lid.

Measure and mix 65g starter and 300g filtered water in a mixing bowl. Make sure that the starter is well mixed, this step is crucial for an even crumb. Feed your leftover starter and put in fridge or counter for next use.

Measure 430g bread flour, add to bowl and mix. The dough will be sticky and shaggy.

Measure 10g salt and either pour over the top or wait 30 minutes and add to mixture. I prefer over the top, the salt will start sweating and makes it easier to mix into the dough.

Cover bowl with lid or damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes. This stage is called autolyse.

### 3. Autolyse

After 30 minutes, mix the salt into the dough. Don't try to over knead it, just until you don't feel salt on your fingers when you touch the dough.

At this time, get the temperature of your dough. It will be a little warmer since you have just worked it with your hands.

Cover dough and let sit for 30 mins.

### 4. Stretch and Fold

After 30 mins, your dough should be a little more relaxed and glossy looking.

Wet your hands, pinch and graby one side of the dough with both hands and pull up. Stretch until you feel some resistance and fold into the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Continue until you have completed all four sides. You will feel the dough tighten as you go around.

Take the temperature of the dough, you should notice how the thermometor comes out cleaner than before.

Cover and let sit for 30 mins. I like to do this step two more times for optimal gluten development, but one will suffice. The more stretch and folds you do, the better crumb and final shape of your dough.

### 5. Bulk Fermentation

The is the main and most important step. Leave your dough covered on the counter for 7 hours after you start step 2. My dough temp is generally 73 degrees. A good rule of thumb is to add or remove 20 minutes from the bulk time per degree difference. So if your dough is reading 74 degrees at the stretch and fold, then only set it out for 6 hours and 40 minutes.

### 6. Shape

After your 7 hours is up, your dough should look smooth and have both large and small bubbles on the surface. It should have risen about 30%.

Lightly flour your counter and scrape your dough out of the bowl. Get a bench scraper or use your hands to perform a letter fold.

Fold the left side into the center, then the right side into the center. Take the bottom and fold to the top and complete the fold by folding the top side to the bottom towards you.

Use the bench scraper or your hands to flip the dough. With the bench scraper or the palm of your hand gently form the dough into a circle with smooth, sweeping movements around and slightly in making the dough tighten.

Let sit for 20 minutes.

### 7. Proof

After 20 minutes, your dough should be more relaxed. Scrape any flour away from the counter next to the dough. You don't want a lot of flour at this stage or the dough won't stick together after shaping.

Use the bench scraper or your hands to flip the dough onto the clear counter. Perform another letter fold and shape into a ball. This will create a boule.

Get your banneton basket or bowl and add a liner. If you don't have a liner use a cotton dishtowel and lightly mist it with water. Sprinkle rice flour or all-purpose flour onto the liner. Make sure it is all up the sides, you don't want your dough to stick.

Flip your shaped dough and gently place it into your bowl or banneton. Pinch together any parts of the dough where it is separting. This will make for a smooth bottom crust.

Cover with a plastic shower cap, ziploc bag, or damp towel and place in the fridge for 12-13 hours.

### 8. Bake

Preheat your oven to 500 degrees with the pot and lid in the oven. If you are using a challenger pan, preheat the oven for an hour, for a dutch oven only 30 minutes.

When your oven is preheated, you can score the dough and prepare for bake. Score the dough with a classic crescent, cross, or slash down the middle. You can use a knife or a bread lame to perform the score.

For a Dutch oven:

Place parchment paper on your counter and flip dough out of the bowl or banneton. Once scored, carry the dough into the preheated pot, mist with water, and cover with lid in oven.

For Challenger Bread Pan:

Fip dough straight onto the preheated base pan. Add two ice cubes, cover with lid, and place in oven.

Turn oven down to 450 degrees and bake covered for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, remove the lid from the dutch oven and bake for 18-20 minutes until brown, not burnt. If you are using the Challenger pan, take the lid off and place the base onto the inverted lid and put back in oven.
