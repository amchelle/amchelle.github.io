This is one of my favorite sourdough recipes! The sweet cinnamom is heavenly and stays soft for days.

### What are the timings?

- **1:00 pm:** feed starter
- **7:00 pm:** mix dough and autolyse
- **8:00 pm:** add raisins
- **8:30 pm:** stretch and fold
- **9:00 pm:** stretch and fold
- **8:00 am(next day):** shape and second rise (proof)
- **12:00 pm:** bake

# Step by Step Instructions

### 1. Feed your starter

I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.

### 2. Mix your dough and autolyse

Once your starter is at peak, bubbly, and doubled in size you will make your dough. My starter takes about 5-6 hours. This is going to vary depending on the temperature of your home.

For your dough you can use a ceramic, Pyrex, glass, or stainless steel bowl. I like to use a Pyrex bowl and a glass lid.

Measure and mix 90g starter and 270g filtered water in a mixing bowl. Feed your leftover starter and put in fridge or counter for next use.

Measure 450g bread flour and 10g salt, add to bowl and mix slowly. The dough will be sticky and shaggy. Measure 2 tbsp butter and cut into cubes over the bowl. Use your hands to knead and incorporate the butter. It will soften and combine as you mix. Knead until all butter if fully dissolved.

Cover bowl with lid or damp towel and let sit for 1 hour. This stage is called autolyse.

### 3. Soak Raisins

Measure raisins and add to a cup. Fill with water and let soak for the remainder of the autolyse hour in Step 2.

### 4. Add Raisins

Drain raisins and add to dough. Lightly knead until well dispersed. Let sit covered for 30 minutes.

### 5. Stretch and Fold

After 30 mins, your dough should be a little more relaxed and glossy looking.

Wet your hands, pinch and grab one side of the dough with both hands and pull up. Stretch until you feel some resistance and fold into the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Continue until you have completed all four sides. You will feel the dough tighten as you go around.

Cover and let sit for 30 mins. I like to do this step one to two more times for optimal gluten development, but one will suffice.

### 6. Bulk Fermentation

Leave your dough covered on the counter for 12-13 hours (overnight) after you start step 2.

### 7. Shape

In the morning, your dough should look smooth and have both large and small bubbles on the surface. It should have risen 50%.

Lightly flour your counter and scrape your dough out of the bowl. Grease the inside of your loaf pan and set it at the top of your dough. Gently shape the dough into a rectangle and pull the dough to the width of your loaf pan. Poke the dough with your fingers to press out any bubbles.

### 8. Fill & Roll

Measure and mix 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a bowl. Sprinkle evenly over rectangle dough. Try to avoid the sides, as it will seep out when baked.

Take one width side and roll the dough. With each roll, gently press the edges down to keep the filling intact.

### 9. Proof (second rise)

Cover with a damp dish towel and let sit for about 4 hours. The dough will have risen well above the rim of the loaf pan. If you poke the dough, it should very slowly rise back. If you don't properly proof at this stage, your finished loaf will tear on the sides and break its shape. This stage ranges anywhere from 2 to 6 hours. The number one issue with this loaf is not letting it proof long enough.

### 10. Bake

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Let sit in pan for 10 minutes after baking. Remove from loaf pan and let sit for at least 1 hour before slicing.
