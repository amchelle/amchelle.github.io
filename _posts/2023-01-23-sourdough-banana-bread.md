Sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee and makes your home smell so wonderful.

Add nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking. This recipe has very little sugar, bananas are so sweet on their own. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees

### 2. Cream sugar & butter

In a mixing bowl cream 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter until smooth.
