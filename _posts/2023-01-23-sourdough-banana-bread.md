Sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee and makes your home smell so wonderful.

Add nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking. This recipe has very little sugar, bananas are so sweet on their own. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana!

# Step by Step Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees
