<p>I remember when I first started making sourdough, I was so confused on the timings, how to handle the starter, and notice the change in fermenation. Stripping back to the basics can help you get the hang on things and understand how sourdough works before adding the stretch and folds, coil folds, lamination, cold proofs and so on.</p>

<p>This loaf has a very low hydration. Sourdough hydration is the ratio of water to flour. You can learn more about sourdough hydration levels <a href="https://www.sourdoughathome.com/general/2023/02/08/understanding-sourdough-hydration-levels/">here</a>. Lower hydration is much easier to work with and shape and great for beginners. As you become more experience you can start increasing the amount of water you use.</p>
