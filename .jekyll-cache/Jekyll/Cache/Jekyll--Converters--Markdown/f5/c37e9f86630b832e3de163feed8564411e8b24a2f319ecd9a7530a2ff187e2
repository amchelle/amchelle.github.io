I"W<p>Making a sourdough starter can feel like a daunting task, but it is worth the pain! The starter is the first lesson of patience that comes with all things sourdough.</p>

<p><strong>Tell Me How Long</strong></p>

<p>I have heard that some people get theirs started in 6 days, but to be honest I can’t believe it. Mine took a whopping 18 days! I thought it would never rise, but it did with some crucial troubleshooting steps and days of research.</p>

<p><strong>Please Tell Me I Don’t Have to Feed This Thing Everyday</strong></p>

<p>Your starter is a living thing that needs to be fed and cared for. Once your starter is really going, you shouldn’t let it miss a feeding pass 12 hours. Based on the temperature of your home and time of year the ideal time to feed varies.</p>
