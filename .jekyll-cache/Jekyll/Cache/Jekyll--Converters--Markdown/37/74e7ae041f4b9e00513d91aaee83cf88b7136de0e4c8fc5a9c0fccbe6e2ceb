<h1 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step by Step Instructions</h1>

<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>Since we want to mix our dough in the morning, we need to feed our starter with more flour so that it can last throughout the night.</p>

<p>For this recipe I feed mine 75g all-purpose, 50g water, 50g starter. Feel free to add 10g to each ingredient if you want more of a buffer.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>

<p>Measure and mix 150g water and 100g starter in a mixing bowl. Add 300g all-purpose flour and combine with hands until the flour is absorbed. Cover with a damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="3-knead">3. Knead</h3>

<p>Knead lightly for a few minutes to incorporate any dry flour and then form into a smooth ball. Cover with towel and let sit for 5-6 hours.</p>

<h3 id="4-cut">4. Cut</h3>

<p>Clean countertop and heavily flour. Scrape dough out of bowl and cut with a bench knife into sections of about 15g. Roll each section into a ball with hands. You’ll hear the bubbles squeak as you do so.</p>

<h3 id="5-roll">5. Roll</h3>

<p>Take one dough ball and press with the palm of your hand to flatten it. Dust with flour and then dust your rolling pin. In one movement with the rolling pin, roll away from you with mild pressure on the dough. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll again. Repeat for two more rotations until you have gone all the way around. Each dumpling wrapper should be about 2 1/2 inches.</p>

<p>They might look thicker than expected, but this is normal. You don’t want them splitting on the sides when you add the filling and stretch the dough to seal.</p>

<h3 id="6-fill">6. Fill</h3>

<p>Combine pork filling ingredients into a large bowl. This can be made ahead of time and kept in fridge.</p>

<p>Fill each wrapper with about a tablespoon of filling. You can either scoop the filling and place on each wrapper or take the wrapper in one hand and with the other scoop the filling and then use the opposing pressure to scrape the filling onto the wrapper. This method is easier and faster.</p>

<p>I like to fill the dumplings in sections of about 6 since this is what my steamer can fit. I put the filling back in the fridge if there are large times between filling.</p>

<h3 id="7-fold">7. Fold</h3>

<p>Take the filled dumpling in both hands and gently fold the dough up so that the edges barely come together. Start for the left or right, whichever feels more comfortable and pinch that side edge to create a seal. With your opposing hand, use your fingers to create a pleat by pushing laterally to get a little section of dough and then pinching down. Imagine pleating curtains. Take your time and go slow on the first few. It is 100% fine if you do not have perfect dumpling pleats, they will still taste good!</p>

<p>If the pleating isn’t working, then just fold the dumpling edges up and pinch to seal the edges together. Make sure you seal the edges will so they don’t split oven when cooking.</p>

<p>Your main goal at this step is to make sure you don’t tear the dumpling wrappers.</p>
