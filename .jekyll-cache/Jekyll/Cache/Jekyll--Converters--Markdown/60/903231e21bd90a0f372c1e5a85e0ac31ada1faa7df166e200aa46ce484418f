I"9<p>Sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee and makes your home smell so wonderful.</p>

<p>Add nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking. This recipe has very little sugar, bananas are so sweet on their own. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana!</p>

<h3 id="4-stretch-and-fold">4. Stretch and Fold</h3>

<p>After 30 mins, your dough should be a little more relaxed and glossy looking.</p>

<p>Wet your hands, pinch and graby one side of the dough with both hands and pull up. Stretch until you feel some resistance and fold into the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Continue until you have completed all four sides. You will feel the dough tighten as you go around.</p>

<p>Take the temperature of the dough, you should notice how the thermometor comes out cleaner than before.</p>

<p>Cover and let sit for 30 mins. I like to do this step two more times for optimal gluten development, but one will suffice. The more stretch and folds you do, the better crumb and final shape of your dough.</p>

<h3 id="6-scrape">6. Scrape</h3>

<p>In the morning, your dough should look smooth and have both large and small bubbles on the surface. It should have risen 50%.</p>

<p>Lightly flour your counter and scrape your dough out of the bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="7-proof-second-rise">7. Proof (second rise)</h3>

<p>Grease the inside of your loaf pan and set it at the top of your dough. Gently shape the dough into a rectangle and pull the dough to the width of your loaf pan. Roll up the dough and place seam side down in loaf pan. Cover with a damp dishtowel and let sit for 2 hours. The dough will have risen to just about level with rim of loaf pan.</p>
