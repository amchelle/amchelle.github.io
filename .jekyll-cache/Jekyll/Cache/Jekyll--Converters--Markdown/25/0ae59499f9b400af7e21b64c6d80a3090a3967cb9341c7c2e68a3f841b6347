I"…<p>My family LOVES tortillas! I make them all the time. They are easy to whip up and great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>These sourdough tortillas are excellent for egg breakfast tacos, fish tacos, or fajitas! If you donâ€™t eat them all, you can pop them in the fridge and reheat them the next day for an easy taco breakfast.</p>

<p>If you want to make them ahead, you can freeze the rolled tortillas in between pieces of parchment paper and keep in a ziploc bag. Once you are ready to cook, let them defrost for about 15 minutes on the counter before heating.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Choice</strong></p>

<p>Beef tallow is my favorite fat to use, but if you donâ€™t have this on hand then olive oil is a great alternative. Traditionally, tortillas are made with lard, which you can swap in for the fat, but pork products are not my favorite. Since beef tallow is equally fatty and delicious, I always use this first.</p>

<p><strong>Cooking</strong></p>

<p>A cast-iron skillet is your best choice for cooking. If you have a lot of smoke and burnt tortillas, your heat is too high. You should see puffing and bubbles in about 20-30 seconds. The second side of the tortilla will cook much faster. Tortillas are normally cooked on a non-greased skillet, but you can add fat if desired. Make sure that your burner is set lower and use a cooking fat with a high smoke point so stay away from olive oil.</p>
