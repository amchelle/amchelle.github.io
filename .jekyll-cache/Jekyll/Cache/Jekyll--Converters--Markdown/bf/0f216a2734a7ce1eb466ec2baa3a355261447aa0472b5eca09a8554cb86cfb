I"w<p>Having the proper tools makes the sourdough process easier and more reliable. You will definitely notice the difference in your final loaf.</p>

<p><strong>Starter Jar</strong></p>

<p>You will need a <a href="https://amzn.to/3S4OXFD">glass jar with a lid</a> for your starter. Any Mason Jar style will do. The lid part is very important. I have tried using a paper towel with a rubber band but your starter gets a dry film over the top that is not ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Danish Whisk</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3YC2yWQ">danish whisk</a> isnâ€™t required but it makes mixing the dough and starter much much easier. I put off purchasing this for a year thinking it was a waste, but it is worth it. You can also use a spoon/fork or silicone spatula. An alternative to this is a <a href="https://amzn.to/40Kz7DT">bread stirrer</a> that is a little narrower and fits into most starter jars.</p>

<p><strong>Scale</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3JXC9yw">scale</a> that measures grams. You will use this for your starter and dough.</p>

<p><strong>Bowl</strong></p>

<p>Glass, ceramic, or Pyrex bowl. I like to use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xgs7eY">Pyrex casserole dish</a> with a lid. The dual use for baking comes in handy and the lid makes great dough.</p>

<p><strong>Instant Read Thermometer</strong></p>

<p>An <a href="https://amzn.to/3EljNnN">instant read thermometer</a> is useful for making consistent bread each time. You can take the temp of your dough during bulk fermentation to estimate how long it needs to rise. If it is warmer cut it short, if it is colder go a little longer.</p>

<p><strong>Plastic Scraper and Bench Knife</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://amzn.to/40NKhb2">plastic scraper</a> is not required, but it helps get the fermented dough out of your bowl in one go instead of scraping it with your hands. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3llQUkt">bench knife</a> is more essential. You will use this for shaping and cutting.</p>
