I"ã<p>Hydration levels are very important in sourdough baking. They affect many parts of the sourdough process from crumb to crust to fermentation time. Understanding its affects can make you a better sourdough baker and be able to adjust to your enviromentâ€™s change in humididty and temperature.</p>

<p>The hydration percentage is calcuated by dividing the amount of water by the amount flour and then multiplying the resulting proportion by 100. Flour is always your divisor. For example, given 45g water and 90g flour you would perform the following cacluation:</p>

<p>45 / 90 x 100 = 50% hydration level.</p>

<p>Now that you understand what hydration level means, letâ€™s go on to how that level affects your starter and bread.</p>
