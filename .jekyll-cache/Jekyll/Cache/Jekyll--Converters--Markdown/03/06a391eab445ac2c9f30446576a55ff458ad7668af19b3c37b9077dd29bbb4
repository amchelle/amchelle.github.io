I"Å<p>Your go to classic sourdough loaf. Crunchy, golden crust with soft crumb and so much flavor! Follow this recipe to make your best loaf with a beautiful ear and perfect taste.</p>

<p>I have tested different ingredient combinations, temperature and time fluctuations, and hydration levels to get my signature classic sourdough. This is my go to daily loaf! I generally prefer a tighter even crumb. I donâ€™t like large holes in my daily bread, I save that for more artisanal loaves. If you desire larger holes, you can add more water to this recipe and make sure you perform all three strech and folds.</p>

<h1 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step by Step Instructions</h1>

<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>
<p>I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>
<p>Once your starter is a peak, bubbly, and doubled in size you will make your dough. My starter takes about 5-6 hours. This is going to vary depending on the temperature of your home.</p>

<p>For your dough you can use a ceramic, Pyrex, glass, or stainless steel bowl. I like to use a Pyrex bowl and a glass lid.</p>

<p>Measure and mix starter and water in bowl. Make sure that the starter is well mixed, this step is crucial for an even crumb.</p>

<p>Measure 430g bread flour, add to bowl, and mix. The dough will be sticky and shaggy.</p>

<p>Measure 10g salt and either pour over the top or wait 30 minutes and add to mixture. I prefer over the top, the salt will start sweating and makes it easier to mix into the dough.</p>

<p>Cover bowl with lid or damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes. This stage is called autolyse.</p>

<h3 id="3-autolyse">3. Autolyse</h3>

<p>After 30 minutes, mix the salt into the dough. Donâ€™t try to over knead it, just until you donâ€™t feel salt on your fingers when you touch the dough.</p>

<p>At this time, get the temperature of your dough. It will be a little warmer since you have just worked it with your hands.</p>

<p>Cover dough and let sit for 30 mins.</p>

<h3 id="4-stretch-and-fold">4. Stretch and Fold</h3>

<p>After 30 mins, your dough should be a little more relaxed and glossy looking.</p>

<p>Wet your hands, pinch and graby one side of the dough with both hands and pull up. Stetch until you feel some resistance and fold into the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Continue until you have completed all four sides. You will feel the dough tighten as you go around.</p>

<p>Take the temperature of the dough, you should notice how the thermometor comes out cleaner than before.</p>

<p>Cover and let sit for 30 mins. I like to do this step two more times for optimal gluten development, but one will suffice. The more stretch and folds you do, the better crumb and final shape of your dough.</p>

<h3 id="5-bulk-fermentation">5. Bulk Fermentation</h3>

<p>The is the main and most important step. Leave your dough covered on the counter for 7 hours after you start step 2. My dough temp is generally 73 degrees. A good rule of thumb is to add or remove 20 minutes from the bulk time per degree difference. So if you dough is reading 74 degrees at the stretch and fold, then only set it out for 6 hours and 40 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="6-shape">6. Shape</h3>

<p>After your 7 hours is up, your dough should look smooth and have both large and small bubbles on the surface. It should have risen about 30%.</p>

<p>Lightly flour your counter and scrape your dough out of the bowl. Get a</p>
