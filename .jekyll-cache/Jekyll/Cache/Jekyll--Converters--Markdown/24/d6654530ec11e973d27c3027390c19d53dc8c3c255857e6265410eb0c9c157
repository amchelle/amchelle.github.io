I"z<p>This sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee. This recipe has very little sugar and no sugar options. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana to make it a no-sugar banana bread!  Add 1/4 cup of nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking.</p>
