<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. For this recipe, I generally feed mine 10g rye, 60g all-purpose, 70g water, 70g starter. Let sit in warm place for about 5-6 hours until starter is at peak and bubbly.</p>

<p>You can do a stiffer starter, but the bulk fermentation time will need to be adjusted.</p>

<h3 id="2-make-dough">2. Make dough</h3>

<p>Measure 344g bread flour and 86g whole wheat or einkorn (430g bread flour if you want white bread). Add flour to bowl and mix 344g filtered water for whole wheat, 323g for einkorn, or 301g for white until fully combined. Dough will be very sticky.</p>

<h3 id="3-autolyse">3. Autolyse</h3>

<p>Let sit covered for at least 1 hour and up to 3 for optimal hydration and gluten development.</p>

<h3 id="4-add-starter">4. Add starter</h3>

<p>Measure 86g active starter and add to dough. Pinch around the dough to make sure all the starter is mixed in, it will take a few minutes of kneading. Let sit covered for 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="5-add-salt">5. Add salt</h3>

<p>Measure 10g salt and add to dough. Mix until you can’t feel any grains with your fingers. Let sit covered for 30 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="6-stretch-and-fold">6. Stretch and fold</h3>

<p>Wet dominant hand and with the other hand grip the edge of the bowl. With your wet hand, grab a section of the dough and gently strech up and out. Fold back into center and rotate bowl. Continue stretching and folding until you have gone all the way around the bowl. The dough should look and feel tighter.</p>

<p>Let sit covered for 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="7-lamination">7. Lamination</h3>

<p>This is the step that gives me consistently nice open crumb. It is also the point where you can add some additions to your dough like sesame seeds or dried fruits (that have been soaked!). You can replace this step with another stretch and fold or a coil fold if you do not have time or space.</p>

<p>Wet hands and counter and pour/scrape dough onto clean wet surface. Gently stretch dough until it is very thin throughout. Be careful to not stetch too far that the dough tears. At this stage you will notice little bubbles that have formed in the dough.</p>

<p>Once you have the dough fully stetched, fold it up like a blanket and put back into bowl. Let sit covered for 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="8-coil-fold">8. Coil fold</h3>

<p>This step can be replaced with a stretch and fold, but I find that at this late stage a coil fold is less disruptive than a stretch and fold.</p>

<p>Wet both hands. Grab the left and right edges of the dough and pull and out of the bowl. Slowly place back down, letting the dough fold onto itself. Rotate bowl 90 degrees and perform another coil fold.</p>

<p>You can add a few more coil folds, in 30-1hr increments if the dough still feels sloppy and wet. The higher the hydration of your dough the more coil folds you will need to do to strengthen the dough.</p>

<h3 id="9-bulk-fermentation">9. Bulk Fermentation</h3>

<p>Leave dough covered on counter in a warm place for about 1 - 3 hours depending on the temperature of your home and humidity. It can be tough to tell when the bulk fermentation is complete but you will get used to it the more you bake. You will see small and medium bubbles all over the surface of the dough. Wheat flour is going to ferment faster than white so keep that in mind as you change up the flours you use.</p>

<h3 id="10-shape">10. Shape</h3>

<p>Once you have decided the bulk fermentation stage is complete, lightly flour your banneton with rice flour. Other flour is fine as well, but rice flour prevents the dough from sticking better because it doesn’t absorb as much moisture.</p>

<p>Scrape your dough out onto a clean, lightly floured counter. Perform a letter fold by taking one side of the dough and stretching it up and then folding towards the center. Repeat with the opposite side and then the remaining two sides. Flip dough over and gently shape into a boule (ball) by using both hands or a bench knife to cup the dough and rotate slightly to create tension.</p>

<p>Let rest for 10-20 minutes and repeat prior step to create a boule. Flip dough seam side up and place into banneton.</p>

<p>If you prefer a more oval shape, then shape the dough into a bâtard. Begin by starting an letter fold but only complete two sides. On one of the adjacent sides, grab the edge with both hands and fold it to about a quarter of the length of the dough. Slowly roll the dough and gently tug towards you with each roll until you have completed the shape. Pinch the edges together and then flip seam side up into a lightly floured banneton.</p>

<p>Cover dough with damp towel or shower cap and place in fridge overnight for at least 12 hours. You can go longer with this stage to develop more flavor.</p>

<h3 id="11-bake">11. Bake</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 500 degrees with the pot and lid in the oven. I recommend using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Hgj5sx">Dutch oven</a> or <a href="https://challengerbreadware.com/?ref=sourdoughathome">Challenger Bread Pan</a>.</p>

<p>Flip dough out of banneton onto a piece of parchment paper that will just fit the dough. You don’t want it too big or it will prevent the sides from browning and also create wringles in the side of the bread. Keep in mind, the parchment paper does need to be large enough to carry the dough to the baking vessel.</p>

<p>Score dough with a slash down the middle or score of choice and carry to baking vessel. Add ice cubes or spritz with water for steam and cover with lid.</p>

<p>Turn oven down to 450 degrees and baking covered for 20 minutes. Remove lid and bake for 20-25 minutes until brown. The dutch oven will need more baking than the Challenger Bread Pan.</p>

<p>Leave the dough to cool until it is cold to the touch, then slice and enjoy! Sometimes you can’t resist cutting into it when it is warm, but it will be a little doughy.</p>
