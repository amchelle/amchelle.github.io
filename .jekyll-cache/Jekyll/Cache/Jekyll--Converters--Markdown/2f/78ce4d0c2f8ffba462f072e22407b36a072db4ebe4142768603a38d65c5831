I"%	<p>This is the easiest, tastiest, butteriest, flakiest pie crust you will every eat. You won’t believe how simple it is to make and why you haven’t been doing it all these years. Apple pies, quiches, pot pies, banana cream pies, the list goes on an on. This is your general use pastry base for all these delicious treats. The best part, its sourdough and can be made ahead of time!</p>

<p>Pies are very underrated as a dessert. I think most are excessively sweet and weirdly gelatinous. Most pies I swing pie at the store are entirely unappealing, but homemade pies are a different story and it all starts with a good crust.</p>

<p>Okay so what is the difference between a pie and a quiche. There really isn’t one, especially when it comes to the crust. Quiche crusts can contain eggs and are filled with some type of savory egg mixture. Pie crusts can be sweetened with sugar, and are either sweet or savory (mostly sweet). Unlike a quiche, pies can have a top crust for those juicy fruit pies.</p>

<h3 id="sugar">Sugar?</h3>

<p>I try my best to limit sugar in most of the food I eat. This pie crust does not need sugar. If you are making a sweet pie, you are really not going to notice that you are missing a tablespoon of sugar in your pie crust. However, if you feel the desire, add about 20g sugar to this recipe and it will be deliciously sweet.</p>

<p>This is my super easy and fast quiche recipe. It is not the custard style quiche with one or two eggs… this recipe is not for you if you want that. It is your full protein style quiche.</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup cheddar or mozzarella cheese (I normally do a combo if I have it)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped ham or turkey</li>
  <li>4 green onion stalks chopped</li>
  <li>Pepperoni toppings (for some reason I always have this leftover and it makes for a delicious topping)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix ingredients and top with optional pepperoni and a sprinkling of any remaining chopped green onions. Bake 350 degrees for 35-40 when fork comes out clean. For the last 5 minutes I am literally opening the oven door all the time so you are not alone. Catching the quiche right when it sets makes it really nice.</p>
