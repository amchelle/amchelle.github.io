<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>Since we want to mix our dough in the morning, we need to feed our starter with more flour so that it can last throughout the night.</p>

<p>For this recipe I feed mine 75g all-purpose, 50g water, 50g starter. Feel free to add 10g to each ingredient if you want more of a buffer.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>

<p>Measure and mix 150g water and 100g starter in a mixing bowl. Add 300g all-purpose flour and combine with hands until the flour is absorbed. Cover with a damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="3-knead">3. Knead</h3>

<p>Knead lightly for a few minutes to incorporate any dry flour and then form into a smooth ball. Cover with towel and let sit for 5-6 hours.</p>
