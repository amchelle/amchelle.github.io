I"Š<p>This overnight sourdough is very basic and easy to make. Sometimes you donâ€™t have time to make that perfect artisanal loaf, but you still want a great tasting bread in the morning!</p>

<p>If you are a beginner and just learning the ropes, this recipe is for you! It will help you get the steps down before you move onto my <a href="https://www.sourdoughathome.com/breads/2023/01/13/classic-sourdough/">classic sourdough recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I remember when I first started making sourdough, I was so confused on the timings, how to handle the starter, and know the difference between bulk fermenation and a proof. Stripping back to the basics can help you get the hang of things and understand how sourdough works before adding the stretch and folds, coil folds, lamination, cold proofs and so on.</p>

<p>This loaf has a very low hydration at 60%. Sourdough hydration is the ratio of water to flour. You can learn more about sourdough hydration levels <a href="https://www.sourdoughathome.com/general/2023/02/08/understanding-sourdough-hydration-levels/">here</a>. Lower hydration is much easier to work with, shape and great for beginners. As you become more experience you can start increasing the amount of water you use.</p>

<p>Since this is a counter overnight ferment, if we add too much water you will end up with a massive batch of smelly vinegary sourdough, not ideal for a good loaf.</p>

<h3 id="1-feed-your-stater">1. Feed your stater.</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do is feed your starter. If it has been in the fridge, let it sit on your counter and warm up for a few hours before feeding. If your starter has been in the fridge for more than a few days I would recommend giving it two feedings before making bread. You want it active enough to rise the dough.</p>

<p>Now if you want to make a really lazy sourdough and you have fed your starter within 48 hours you can take it out of the fridge at noon and use that for the dough. This isnâ€™t going to be the best bread in the world but it is still a fantastic loaf and sometimes there just isnâ€™t enough time in the day.</p>

<p>For this recipe we need 86g of starter. We also need to have enough starter remaining so that we can refeed it and use it in the future. I generally like to have about 50g leftover to feed. When transferring the starter, you lose a bit that you canâ€™t get out of the jar. This comes out to about 15g. Adding all these up, we need about 150g starter in order to make this recipe and refeed. Based off this number, you need to feed at least 50g starter, 50g water, and 50g flour. This is the bare minimum. I like to give myself some leeway and feed a 1:1:1 ratio of 70-80g each. For this recipe take out 70g starter and add 70g filtered water, 60g all-purpose, and 10g rye. You can swap out the rye for all-purpose, but I like the rye if you have it.</p>

<h3 id="2-make-dough">2. Make dough.</h3>

<p>Get a large bowl and set it next to your scale, this will be for your dough. Get another bowl or small cup and place it on your scale. Measure 260g water and 86g starter. I like to measure the starter with the water in the bowl because you can get the exact starter amount without it sticky to the sides. You can also make sure that it floats. If it does, your starter is ready to make bread.</p>

<p>Pour the water and starter into your large bowl and mix until milky. Get another bowl and measure 430g bread flour and 10g salt. Pour into wet mixture and combine until formed a sticky loose ball.</p>

<p>Cover with lid or damp towel and let sit for at least 30 minutes. An hour is preferred if your schedule allows.</p>

<h3 id="3-knead">3. Knead.</h3>

<p>Take the dough out of your bowl and lightly knead in the air for about 15 seconds until the dough is more smoothe and spherical. Your goal is to make the dough tighter and incorporate any dry parts that werenâ€™t mixed in. Place back in bowl and let sit covered for 11-12 hours overnight.</p>

<p>Scrape the dough out of your bowl onto a clean, floured counter using a plastic scraper or a cupped hand in a confident movement.</p>
