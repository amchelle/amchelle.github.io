I"S<p>This sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee. It is the best low or no sugar banana bread that your family will love!</p>

<p>If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana to make it a no-sugar banana bread!  Add 1/4 cup of nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking.</p>

<p>The sourdough discard replaces the sour cream and some of the milk that I would normally put in a standard banana bread. It adds great flavor, nutrition, and creaminess to make your banana bread moist and tender. If you have more discard than this recipe calls for, you can take out the milk entirely and add your extra starter.</p>

<p>In general, don’t swap butter or oil for sourdough discard. It mainly replaces flour and water, milk, sour cream. Butter is important for this recipe and most sweet cakes and cookies to make sure they are moist. You can replace the butter in this recipe with oil, but butter is better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mainly, don’t overmix or overbake. Both of these will result in a dryer cake. Make sure that your butter and sugar is VERY well blended, like a nice frosting. The rest doesn’t need to be mixed as well.</li>
  <li>Don’t cut into the bread right away. Wrap it in foil and let it sit for at least an hour. This is going to trap in the moisture and make a really good banana bread. After it has cooled and you have cut into the bread, store it in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
  <li>Not required for moist bread, but you can replace the 1/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup sour cream. It will make your bread moist, but I tend to like the flavor and consistency better without this addition. The discard does a good job of making up for the loss of sour cream.</li>
  <li>Once out of the oven, you can brush with some type of liquid. Either simple syrup or melted butter with sugar and maybe cinnamon sprinkled on top for an extra kick.</li>
  <li>If you add raisins, dried cranberries, or currants, try soaking them before adding to batter. Dried fruits are water zappers and can take out some of the moisture you want in your banana bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Replace 1/4 cup (25 g) of the all-purpose flour with cocoa powder and add 1/4-1/2 cup chocolate chips. Save some chocolate chips to sprinkle on the top before baking.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-add-some-kick">How can I add some kick?</h3>

<p>Add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I’d recommend keeping the brown sugar in the recipe if you do and try adding this to the chocolate banana bread for a really nice flavor combination.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-make-no-sugar-sourdough-banana-bread">How to make no-sugar sourdough banana bread?</h3>

<p>Recipes in general add way too much sugar. There is a point where you can’t even taste the other flavors because it is so sweet. Most banana bread recipes have about 1 cup of sugar, which is not needed. Bananas are very sweet on their own.</p>

<p>In order to make it no-sugar, take out the sugar entirely and see how you like it. If you want it a little sweeter, then add another banana. Keep in mind that you will need to bake up to the full 55 minutes due to the added moisture.</p>

<p>Instead of adding an extra banana you can try other naturally sweet items like chopped dates, raisins, dried bananas/freeze dried bananas. I’d recommend about 1/4 cup of whichever item you choose. With the dried bananas, I like to just sprinkle them on top instead of combine into the mix. They really take your banana bread to a whole new level. It makes for the ultimate chewy banana flavor.</p>

<h3 id="sugar-substitues">Sugar substitues?</h3>

<p>Brown sugar works especially well in this recipe, but if you don’t have it then you can replace it with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>white sugar</li>
  <li>honey</li>
  <li>maple syrup</li>
  <li>coconut sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-make-it-fermented">How to make it fermented?</h3>

<p>Most of the time, I go from mixing to straight in the oven. However, we aren’t getting the full benefits of fermentation this way. Instead, pop in the fridge for about 6-12 hours. Cover the loaf pan and batter with a plastic bag or shower cap. To be safe, you need to put it in the fridge instead of out on the counter because the batter has eggs and milk.</p>

<p>With this method you can make the batter in the morning and then bake at night or mix at night and let sit in fridge overnight for a morning bake. If your loaf pan is Pyrex or something similar, let it warm to room temp before putting into oven so your container doesn’t crack with the rapid temperature change.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-store">How to store?</h3>

<p>Keep bread in a sealed plastic bag at room temperature for a few days or refrigerate it for a week.</p>

<p>You can also freeze the bread in slices and then reheat individually. This creates a really nice crust that is great with a bit of butter.</p>

<p>The longest I have gone is about 5 hours. This one was 3 hours. The main difference I find is the result in the crumb. It is more open, softer, higher. I think this is especillay important for higher hydration sourdoughs.</p>
