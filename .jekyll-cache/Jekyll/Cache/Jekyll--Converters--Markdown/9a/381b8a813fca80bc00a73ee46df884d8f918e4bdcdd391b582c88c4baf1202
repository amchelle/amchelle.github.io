I"æ<p>This overnight sourdough is very basic and easy to make. Sometimes you donâ€™t have time to make that perfect artisanal loaf, but you still want a great tasting bread in the morning!</p>

<p>If you are a beginner and just learning the ropes, this recipe is for you! It will help you get the steps down and then you can move onto my <a href="https://www.sourdoughathome.com/breads/2023/01/13/classic-sourdough/">classic sourdough recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I remember when I first started making sourdough, I was so confused on the timings, how to handle the starter, and know the difference between bulk fermenation and a proof. Stripping back to the basics can help you get the hang of things and understand how sourdough works before adding the stretch and folds, coil folds, lamination, cold proofs and so on.</p>

<p>This loaf has a very low hydration. Sourdough hydration is the ratio of water to flour. You can learn more about sourdough hydration levels <a href="https://www.sourdoughathome.com/general/2023/02/08/understanding-sourdough-hydration-levels/">here</a>. Lower hydration is much easier to work with and shape and great for beginners. As you become more experience you can start increasing the amount of water you use.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is feed your starter. If it has been in the fridge, let it sit on your counter and warm up for a few hours before feeding. If your starter has been in the fridge for more than a few days I would recommend giving it two feedings before making bread. You want it active enough to rise the dough.</p>
