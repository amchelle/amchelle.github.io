I"'<p>This is the easiest, tastiest, butteriest, flakiest pie crust you will every eat. You won’t believe how simple it is to make and why you haven’t been doing it all these years. Apple pies, quiches, pot pies, banana cream pies, the list goes on an on. This is your general use pastry base for all these delicious treats. The best part, it’s sourdough and can be made ahead of time! Try out my fully packed protein quiche and no sugar apple juice sweetened apple pie!</p>

<p>Pies are very underrated as a dessert. I think most are excessively sweet and weirdly gelatinous. Most pies I swing by at the store are entirely unappealing, but homemade pies are a different story and it all starts with a good crust.</p>

<h3 id="pie-vs-quiche">Pie vs. Quiche</h3>

<p>Okay so what is the difference between a pie and a quiche. There really isn’t one, especially when it comes to the crust. Quiche crusts can contain eggs and are filled with some type of savory egg mixture. Pie crusts can be sweetened with sugar, and are either sweet or savory (mostly sweet). Unlike a quiche, pies can have a top crust for those juicy fruit pies or meat pot pies.</p>

<h3 id="pie-top-crust">Pie top crust</h3>

<p>For a top crust simply double the recipe. There are different variations from a full top crust to a lattice crust. If you are doing a full cover top crust, make sure you cut slits in the top in order to vent steam during baking. It is also crucial that you really pinch together the edges of the top and bottom layer crust so that the filling doesn’t seep out the sides.</p>

<h3 id="sugar">Sugar?</h3>

<p>I try my best to limit sugar in most of the food I eat. This pie crust does not need sugar. If you are making a sweet pie, you are really not going to notice that you are missing a tablespoon of sugar in your pie crust. However, if you feel the desire, add about 20g sugar to this recipe and it will be deliciously sweet. Besides added sweetness, adding sugar to the crust will give it a deeper golden color.</p>

<h3 id="blind-baked-par-baked-unbaked">Blind Baked, Par-Baked, Unbaked?</h3>

<p>Some recipes will call for a fully blind baked pie crust. This means that the pie crust is fully cooked before any filling is added. You’ll do this for a banana cream pie or a tart. Something that sets in the fridge instead of baked.</p>

<h3 id="apple-juice-sweetened-no-sugar-apple-pie-recipe">Apple Juice Sweetened No Sugar Apple Pie Recipe</h3>

<p>You have got to try this! If you are on a war against processed sugar but have a sweet tooth craving this is a pretty great alternative.</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 apples</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
  <li>2 tablesppoons butter</li>
  <li>1-2 cups apple or grape juice (start slow!)</li>
  <li>1 egg mixed</li>
</ul>

<p>Get about 5 (sweet) apples, not Granny Smith. Peel, core, and finely chop into slices. In a large pot add butter, apples, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1-2 cups apple juice depending on sweetness level. Boil and then let simmer until thick. Let cool.</p>

<p>Pour mixture into unbaked pie crust, cover with lattice or top crust and brush with egg mixture. Bake in a preheated oven at 450 degrees for about 45-50 minutes.</p>

<p>My grandma would always say bake the apple pie until you hear its heartbeat, like a big thwomp. I have only gotten this once or twice in my life but the pies have been perfect when this happens.</p>

<p>You can swap this out for grape juice if you want it to be even sweeter! I also use this recipe and swap out the fruit depending on the season. Strawberry peach or strawberry rhubarb are some of my favorite alternatives!</p>

<h3 id="my-hearty-quiche-recipe">My Hearty Quiche Recipe</h3>

<p>This is my super easy and fast quiche recipe. It is not the custard style quiche with one or two eggs… this recipe is not for you if you want that. It is your full protein style quiche that will make you and your family full and happy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup cheddar or mozzarella cheese (I normally do a combo if I have it)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped ham or turkey</li>
  <li>4 green onion stalks chopped</li>
  <li>Pepperoni toppings (for some reason I always have this leftover and it makes for a delicious topping)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix ingredients and pour into a par-baked pie crust, top with optional pepperoni and a sprinkling of any remaining chopped green onions. Bake 350 degrees for 35-40 when fork comes out clean. For the last 5 minutes I am literally opening the oven door all the time so you are not alone. Catching the quiche right when it sets makes it really nice.</p>
