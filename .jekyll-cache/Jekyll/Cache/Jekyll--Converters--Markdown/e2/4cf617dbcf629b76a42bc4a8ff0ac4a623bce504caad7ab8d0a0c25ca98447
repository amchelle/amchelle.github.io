I"„<p>Making a sourdough starter can feel like a very daunting task, but it is worth the pain! The starter is the first lesson of patience that comes with all things sourdough.</p>

<p>These are traditionally a very hard crisp cookie made for dunking into tea or coffee. The bigger you make the balls the crunchier the end result.</p>
