</ol>

<p><strong>Tortilla Dough</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make dough.</strong> Measure and mix water and starter in a mixing bowl until fully combined. Add bread flour, salt, and brown sugar. If you are making cinnamon raisin bagels, add the cinnamon at this stage and soak raisins in a cup of water.</li>
  <li><strong>Autolyse.</strong> Dough will be shaggy. Cover with lid or damp towel and let sit for 1 hour.</li>
  <li><strong>Knead.</strong> Knead dough on counter for 1-5 minutes. Place back in bowl and mix raisins into dough.</li>
  <li><strong>Bulk Fermentation.</strong> Leave dough covered for about 11-12 hours after you start step 1.</li>
  <li><strong>Divide Dough.</strong> Scrape dough out of bowl onto counter. Shape into a rectangle log. Use a bench knife to divide into 6 equal sections.</li>
  <li><strong>Shape.</strong> Shape each piece into a mini boule. Take each boule and either poke a hole through the middle and gently use your fingers to increase the circumference or roll the dough into a rope and then attach both ends to create a circle.</li>
  <li><strong>Proof.</strong> Place shaped bagels on a parchment lined cookie sheet or oiled plate and cover with damp towel.</li>
  <li><strong>Preheat Oven &amp; Boil Water.</strong> Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Add 4 cups water to a large cooking pot and boil. Once boiling add 3 tablespoons honey and stir well.</li>
