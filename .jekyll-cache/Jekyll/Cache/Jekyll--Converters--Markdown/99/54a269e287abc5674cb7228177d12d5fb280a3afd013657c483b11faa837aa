I"Â<p>Sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee and makes your home smell so wonderful. Add 1/4 cup of nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking. This recipe has very little sugar, bananas are so sweet on their own. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana to make it a no-sugar banana bread!</p>

<p>The sourdough discard replaces the sour cream and some of the milk that I would normally put in a standard banana bread. It adds great flavor, nutrition, and creaminess to make your banana bread moist and tender. If you have more discard than this recipe calls for, you can take out the milk entirely and add your extra starter.</p>

<p>In general, donâ€™t swap butter or oil for sourdough discard. It mainly replaces flour and water, milk, sour cream. Butter is important for this recipe and most sweet cakes and cookies to make sure they are moist.</p>

<h1 id="how-can-i-make-my-banana-bread-more-moist">How can I make my banana bread more moist?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Mainly, donâ€™t over mix or overbake. Both of these will result in a dryer cake. Make sure that your butter and sugar is VERY well blended, like a nice frosting. The rest doesnâ€™t need to be mixed as well.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t cut into the bread right away. Wrap it in foil and let it sit for at least an hour. This is going to trap in the moisture and make a really good banana bread. After if has cooled and you have cut into the bread, store it in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t think you need this but you can replace the 1/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup sour cream. It will make it moisture but I tend to like the flavor and consistency better without this addition. The discard does a good job of making up for the loss of sour cream.</li>
  <li>Once out of the oven, you can brush with some type of liquid. Either simple syrup or melted butter with sugar and maybe cinnamon sprinkled on top for an extra kick.</li>
  <li>If you add raisins, dried cranberries, or currants, try soaking them before adding to mix. Dried fruits are water zappers and can take out some of the moisture you want in your banana bread.</li>
