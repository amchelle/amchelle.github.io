I"y<p>My family LOVES tortillas! I make them all the time. They are easy to whip up and great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>These sourdough tortillas are excellent for egg breakfast tacos, fish tacos, or fajitas! If you don’t eat them all, you can pop them in the fridge and reheat them the next day for an easy taco breakfast.</p>

<p>If you want to make them ahead, you can freeze the rolled tortillas in between pieces of parchment paper and keep in a ziploc bag. Once you are ready to cook, let them defrost for about 15 minutes on the counter before heating.</p>

<p>Make burrito style large tortillas by only cutting the dough into sections of 4 instead of 8.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Choice</strong></p>

<p>Beef tallow is my favorite fat to use, but if you don’t have this on hand then olive oil is a great alternative. Traditionally, tortillas are made with lard, which you can swap in for the fat, but pork products are not my favorite. Since beef tallow is equally fatty and delicious, I always use this first.</p>

<p><strong>Cooking</strong></p>

<p>A cast-iron skillet is your best choice for cooking. If you have a lot of smoke and burnt tortillas, your heat is too high. You should see puffing and bubbles in about 20-30 seconds. The second side of the tortilla will cook much faster. Tortillas are normally cooked on a non-greased skillet, but you can add fat if desired. Make sure that your burner is set lower and use a cooking fat with a high smoke point, so stay away from olive oil.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-timings">What are the timings?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8:00 am:</strong> feed starter</li>
  <li><strong>12:00 pm:</strong> mix dough</li>
  <li><strong>3:00 pm:</strong> divide and roll</li>
  <li><strong>3:15 pm:</strong> cook</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step by Step Instructions</h1>

<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.</p>

<h3 id="2-make-dough">2. Make dough</h3>

<p>Measure 130g water, 152g starter, and 3 tbsp fat of choice. Stir until mix turns cloudy in color. Add 330g all-purpose flour and 10g salt and mix with hands until flour is fully incorporated and dough is slighty sticky to the touch.</p>

<h3 id="3-cover-dough">3. Cover dough</h3>

<p>Cover dough with a damp towel and let sit for 1 - 3 hours.</p>

<h3 id="4-divide-dough">4. Divide dough</h3>

<p>Clean countertop and work dough with hands into a rough ball. Place on counter and divide into 8 pieces with a bench knife. Begin by first cutting in half, then cutting perpendicular to your previous cut making a cross. You will have 4 pieces. Cut each piece in half to make 8 equal sections. If you want to make burritos leave at 4 large sections and begin rolling.</p>

<h3 id="5-roll-tortillas">5. Roll tortillas</h3>

<p>Preheat cast-iron skillet to medium heat. Using a rolling pin, roll each section into a flat, circular shape. You do not need to flour or grease your counter or rolling pin, the fat in the dough is enough to prevent the tortilla from sticking. Your shape does not need to be perfectly circular, homemade means unique! You can roll all the tortillas at once or roll one at a time before cooking. I generally roll two, begin cooking and while waiting for the tortilla to cook roll another.</p>

<h3 id="6-cook">6. Cook</h3>

<p>Once pan is hot, place tortilla on ungreased or greased skillet. At 20-30 seconds you should see bubbling and flip to the other side using a spatula. If you are getting burnt blisters and a lot of smoke then turn down your pan. You may also have residual oil in the pan from previous cooking that needs to be wiped away. Repeat cooking the remaining tortillas and eat hot. I like to store them between two plates or a caserole style dish with lid to keep warm.</p>
