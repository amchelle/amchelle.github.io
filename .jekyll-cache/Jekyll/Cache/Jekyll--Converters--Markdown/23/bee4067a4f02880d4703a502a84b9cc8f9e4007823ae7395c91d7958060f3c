I"<p>Hydration levels are very important in sourdough baking. They affect many parts of the sourdough process from crumb to crust to fermentation time. Understanding its affects will make you a better sourdough baker and give you the ability to adjust to your enviroment’s change in humidity and temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Hydration Percentage</strong></p>

<p>The hydration percentage is calcuated by dividing the amount of water by the amount flour and then multiplying the resulting proportion by 100. Flour is always your divisor. For example, given 45g water and 90g flour you would perform the following cacluation:</p>

<p>45 / 90 x 100 = 50% hydration level.</p>

<p>Now that you understand what hydration level means, let’s go on to how that level affects your starter and bread.</p>

<p><strong>Hydration Levels for Your Starter</strong></p>

<p>The most common hydration level for sourdough starters is 100% hydration. This means equal parts flour, water, and usually starter. This is what I generally use for my starter since it is easy to mix, measure, and the flavor is nice.</p>

<p>You can increase the amount of water to be more than 100% for a wet starter. This starter type needs to be fed more often since it ferments faster. Your starter creates microbes of lactic acid bateria and yeast that eat up the sugar from the flour. This in turn creates CO2 bubbles that raise your starter and dough. The more water you have the faster these microbes can move and eat. This can come in handly when you want your starter to reach its peak faster than normal.</p>

<p>You can also do the opposite and decrease the amount of water in your starter to be less than 100% for a stiff starter. 
This type of starter is commonly referred to the Italian name of lievito madre. A stiff starter will have more mellow of a flavor which can be useful for recipes that you don’t want sour like pastries. Keep in mind that this starter will take much longer to rise since the microbes disperse slower.</p>
