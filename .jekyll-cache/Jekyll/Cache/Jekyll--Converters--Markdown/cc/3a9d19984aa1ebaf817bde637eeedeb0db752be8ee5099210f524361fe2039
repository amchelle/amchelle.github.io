I";<p>Making a sourdough starter can feel like a daunting task, but it is worth the pain! The starter is the first lesson of patience that comes with all things sourdough.</p>

<p><strong>Tell Me How Long</strong></p>

<p>I have heard that some people get theirs started in 6 days, but to be honest I can’t believe it. Mine took a whopping 18 days! I thought it would never rise, but it did with some crucial troubleshooting steps and days of research.</p>

<p><strong>Please Tell Me I Don’t Have to Feed This Thing Everyday</strong></p>

<p>Your starter is a living thing that needs to be fed and cared for. Once your starter is really going, you shouldn’t let it miss a feeding pass 12 hours. Based on the temperature of your home and time of year the ideal time to feed varies.</p>

<p><strong>Common Issues</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You are messing with your starter too much. Sometimes it just needs to be left alone to do its thing. It is a journey not a race.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your house it too cold. Especially for the first few days it needs to be really warm. Once you to normal daily feedings anywhere from 68-73 is ideal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting Tips</strong></p>

<p>If you are at day 10 and just not seeing anything, then it is time to give your starter and little help.</p>

<p>Tip #1:</p>

<p>Try switching up the flour. Make sure you are using unbleached and preferrably organic flour. Organic flour has more minerals in it that your starter can absorb.</p>

<p>Tip #2:</p>

<p>Put your starter in the oven with the light bulb on for 10 mins and then turn it off. Your ideal temperature is 80 degrees. DO NOT turn on your oven, this will most certainly kill your starter. Keep your starter in there for 12 hours, check it and see it</p>
