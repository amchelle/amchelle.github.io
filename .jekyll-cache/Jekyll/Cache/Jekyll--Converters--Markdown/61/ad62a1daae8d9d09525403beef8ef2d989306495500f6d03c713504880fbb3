I"Ö<p>Sourdough lemon bread is sweet, tangy, and fluffy. Great with a cup of afternoon tea.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you like it extra lemony, donâ€™t add too much lemon juice. It will make the loaf dense and chewy with the extra liquid. Instead try adding more lemon zest. Another option is to add more lemon juice to the top of the loaf before adding the glaze.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use fresh lemon juice vs bottled!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be careful with the lemon and milk. Lemon is very acidic and will curdle the milk. Try to add these separately to both the glaze and main mixture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not over mix, it will not be as fluffy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every oven is different, so start checking the loaf at the 40 minute mark. You want it moist but not gooey. There is a sweet spot before it goes dry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-glaze">7. Glaze</h3>

<p>Once the loaf has cooled, pour 1 tablespoon of lemon juice over the top of the loaf. Stir 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon milk in a cup. Once combined, add 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Spread the glaze over the loaf, lightly zest lemon on top and let set. You can do less sugar or more lemon juice, but you want the consistency of the glaze to be thick or it will drain down the side.</p>
