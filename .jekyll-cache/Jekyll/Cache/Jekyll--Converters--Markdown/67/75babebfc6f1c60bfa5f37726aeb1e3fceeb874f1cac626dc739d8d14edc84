I"–<p>My family LOVES tortillas! I make them all the time. They are easy to whip up and great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>These sourdough tortillas are excellent for egg breakfast tacos, fish tacos, or fajitas! If you donâ€™t eat them all, you can pop them in the fridge and reheat them the next day for an easy taco breakfast.</p>

<p>If you want to make them ahead, you can freeze the rolled tortillas in between pieces of parchment paper and keep in a ziploc bag. Once you are ready to cook, let them defrost a bit on the counter before heating.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Choice</strong></p>

<p>Beef tallow is my favorite fat to use, but if you donâ€™t have this on hand then olive oil is a great alternative. Traditionally, tortillas are made with lard, which you can swap in for the fat, but pork products are not my favorite and since beef tallow is equally fatty and delicious I always use this first.</p>
