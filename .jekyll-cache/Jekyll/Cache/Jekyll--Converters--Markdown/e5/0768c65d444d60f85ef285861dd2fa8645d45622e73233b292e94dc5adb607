<h1 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step by Step Instructions</h1>

<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>

<p>Once your starter is at peak, bubbly, and doubled in size you will make your dough. My starter takes about 5-6 hours. This is going to vary depending on the temperature of your home.</p>

<p>For your dough you can use a ceramic, Pyrex, glass, or stainless steel bowl. I like to use a Pyrex bowl and a glass lid.</p>

<p>Measure and mix 90g starter and 270g filtered water in a mixing bowl. Make sure that the starter is well mixed, this step is crucial for an even crumb. Feed your leftover starter and put in fridge or counter for next use.</p>

<p>Measure 450g bread flour and 10g salt, add to bowl and mix slowly. The dough will be sticky and shaggy. Measure 2 tbsp butter and cut into cubes over the bowl. Use your hands to knead and incorporate the butter. It will soften and combine as you mix. Knead until all butter if fully dissolved.</p>

<p>Cover bowl with lid or damp towel and let sit for 1 hour. This stage is called autolyse.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes, mix the salt into the dough. Don’t try to over knead it, just until you don’t feel salt on your fingers when you touch the dough.</p>

<p>At this time, get the temperature of your dough. It will be a little warmer since you have just worked it with your hands.</p>

<p>Cover dough and let sit for 30 mins.</p>

<h3 id="4-stretch-and-fold">4. Stretch and Fold</h3>

<p>After 30 mins, your dough should be a little more relaxed and glossy looking.</p>

<p>Wet your hands, pinch and graby one side of the dough with both hands and pull up. Stretch until you feel some resistance and fold into the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Continue until you have completed all four sides. You will feel the dough tighten as you go around.</p>

<p>Take the temperature of the dough, you should notice how the thermometor comes out cleaner than before.</p>

<p>Cover and let sit for 30 mins. I like to do this step two more times for optimal gluten development, but one will suffice. The more stretch and folds you do, the better crumb and final shape of your dough.</p>

<h3 id="5-bulk-fermentation">5. Bulk Fermentation</h3>

<p>Leave your dough covered on the counter for 11-12 hours (overnight) after you start step 2.</p>

<h3 id="6-scrape">6. Scrape</h3>

<p>In the morning, your dough should look smooth and have both large and small bubbles on the surface. It should have risen 50%.</p>

<p>Lightly flour your counter and scrape your dough out of the bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="7-proof-second-rise">7. Proof (second rise)</h3>

<p>Grease the inside of your loaf pan and set it at the top of your dough. Gently shape the dough into a rectangle and pull the dough to the width of your loaf pan. Roll up the dough and place seam side down in loaf pan. Cover with a damp dishtowel and let sit for 2 hours. The dough will have risen to just about level with rim of loaf pan.</p>

<h3 id="8-bake">8. Bake</h3>

<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Let sit in pan for 10 minutes after baking. Remove from loaf pan and let sit for at least 1 hour before slicing.</p>
