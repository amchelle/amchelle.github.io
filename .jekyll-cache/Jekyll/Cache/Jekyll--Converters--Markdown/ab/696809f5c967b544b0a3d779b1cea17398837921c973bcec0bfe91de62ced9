<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>I recommend a 100% hydration starter for this receipe. This means equal parts water, flour, and beginning starter, a 1:1:1 ratio. I feed mine 10g rye, 70g all-purpose, 80g water, 80g starter.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>

<p>Once your starter is a peak, bubbly, and doubled in size you will make your dough. My starter takes about 5-6 hours. This is going to vary depending on the temperature of your home.</p>

<p>For your dough you can use a ceramic, Pyrex, glass, or stainless steel bowl. I like to use a Pyrex bowl and a glass lid.</p>

<p>Measure and mix 90g starter, 300g filtered water, and 1 tablespoon honey in a mixing bowl. Make sure that the starter is well mixed, this step is crucial for an even crumb. Feed your leftover starter and put in fridge or counter for next use.</p>

<p>Measure 450g bread flour, add to bowl and mix. The dough will be sticky and shaggy.</p>

<p>Measure 10g salt and either pour over the top or wait 30 minutes and add to mixture. I prefer over the top, the salt will start sweating and makes it easier to mix into the dough.</p>

<p>Cover bowl with lid or damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes. This stage is called autolyse.</p>
