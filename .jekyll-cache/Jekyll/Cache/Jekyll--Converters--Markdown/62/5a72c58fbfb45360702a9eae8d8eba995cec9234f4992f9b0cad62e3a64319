I"a<p>My family LOVES tortillas! I make them all the time. They are easy to whip up and great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>These sourdough tortillas are excellent for egg breakfast tacos, fish tacos, or fajitas! If you don’t eat them all, you can pop them in the fridge and reheat them the next day for an easy taco breakfast.</p>

<p>If you want to make them ahead, you can freeze the rolled tortillas in between pieces of parchment paper and keep in a ziploc bag. Once you are ready to cook, let them defrost a bit on the counter before heating.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Choice</strong></p>

<p>Beef tallow if my favorite fat to use, but if you don’t have this on hand then olive oil is a great alternative. Traditionally, tortiallas are made with lard, which is a great choice, but pork products are not my favorite and beef tallow is equally great.</p>
