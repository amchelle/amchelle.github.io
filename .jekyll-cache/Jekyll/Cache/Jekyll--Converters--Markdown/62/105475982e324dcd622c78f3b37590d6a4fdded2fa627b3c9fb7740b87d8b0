I"W<p>Sourdough banana bread is an easy and tasty treat that goes great with a cup of hot coffee and makes your home smell so wonderful.</p>

<p>Add nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips to your liking. This recipe has very little sugar, bananas are so sweet on their own. If you like it sweeter, go up to 1/2 cup of sugar. Or, like I do, remove the sugar entirely and add an extra banana!</p>
