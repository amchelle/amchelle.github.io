<h3 id="1-feed-your-starter">1. Feed your starter</h3>

<p>Since we want to mix our dough in the morning, we need to feed our starter with more flour so that it can last throughout the night.</p>

<p>For this recipe I feed mine 75g all-purpose, 50g water, 50g starter. Feel free to add 10g to each ingredient if you want more of a buffer.</p>

<h3 id="2-mix-your-dough">2. Mix your dough</h3>

<p>Measure and mix 150g water and 100g starter in a mixing bowl. Add 300g all-purpose flour and combine with hands until the flour is absorbed. Cover with a damp towel and let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

<h3 id="3-knead">3. Knead</h3>

<p>Knead lightly for a few minutes to incorporate any dry flour and then form into a smooth ball. Cover with towel and let sit for 5-6 hours.</p>

<h3 id="4-cut">4. Cut</h3>

<p>Clean countertop and heavily flour. Scrape dough out of bowl and cut with a bench knife into sections of about 15g. Roll each section into a ball with hands. Youâ€™ll hear the bubbles squeak as you do so.</p>

<h3 id="5-roll">5. Roll</h3>

<p>Take one dough ball and press with the palm of your hand to flatten it. Dust with flour and then dust your rolling pin. In one movement with the rolling pin, roll away from you with mild pressure on the dough. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll again. Repeat for two more rotations until you have gone all the way around. Each dumpling wrapper should be about 2 1/2 inches.</p>

<p>They might look thicker than expected, but this is normal. You donâ€™t want them splitting on the sides when you add the filling and stretch the dough to seal.</p>
