<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you like it extra lemony, donâ€™t add too much lemon juice. It will make the loaf dense and chewy with the extra liquid. Instead try adding more lemon zest. Another option is to add more lemon juice to the top of the loaf before adding the glaze.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not over mix, it will not be as fluffly.</p>
