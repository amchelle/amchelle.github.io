  <p>Sourdough lover creating and sharing yummy, easy recipies!</p>

  <p>
    Store bought commerical bread would always make me feel tired and lazy. I
    stopped bread altogether and started feeling better but missed bread. Form
    there I decided to introduce gluten-free bread, but that seemed to make me
    feel worse. Then my Mum told me to try sourdough and I am now absolutely
    hooked!

    I NEVER feel bad after eating my fresh bread. I know exactly what is going
    into it and there are no preservatives or weird ingredients. Since sourdough
    is fermented, it is easier for your gut to digest and gives it that great
    sour flavor. Experimenting with better flours and different grains only
    makes your bread more nutritious and tasty. These recipes are the ones I
    make for my family and I try to focus on old fashioned, homestyle baking. No
    overly processing ingredients, but how baking was always meant to be.
