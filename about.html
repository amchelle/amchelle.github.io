  <p>Sourdough lover creating and sharing yummy, easy recipies!</p>

  <p>
    These recipes are my family cookbook. I hope you enjoy making and eating
    them as much as mine. They are focused on being good for your gut and good
    for you.

    I NEVER feel bad after eating my fresh bread. I know exactly what is going
    into it and there are no preservatives or weird ingredients. Since sourdough
    is fermented, it is easier for your gut to digest and gives it that great
    sour flavor. Experimenting with better flours and different grains only
    makes your bread more nutritious and tasty. These recipes are the ones I
    make for my family and I try to focus on old fashioned, homestyle baking. No
    overly processing ingredients, but how baking was always meant to be.
